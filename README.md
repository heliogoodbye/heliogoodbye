# Oh, hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Stelly**, a Nashville-based graphic designer with **over 15 years** of self-taught WordPress development experience. With a passion for both design and roller derby, I have a deep understanding of the unique needs of sports teams and leagues. I am skilled in creating logos, illustrations, websites, and marketing materials that are both visually appealing and effective in communicating an organization's message. 

I'm also a highly motivated and creative individual who is always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of graphic design. I am currently available for limited freelance projects.
